My name is Vsevolod Glumov.

I’m an infinitely curious web backend developer mostly specializing in REST 
APIs and data pipelines, but I’m always happy to try myself in different 
engineering tasks. My instruments of choice are Python, Django (sometimes 
Flask) and various kinds of databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL). I have much 
experience both quickly developing MVPs and prototypes from scratch in startup 
environment and maintaining preexisting large-scale complex architectures. I’m 
also a former technical writer (worked on OpenvCV documentation) and a die hard 
Linux fan.
