My name is Vsevolod Glumov.

I’m a web web-developer mostly specializing in web APIs and backend side of 
things, but I’m always  happy to try myself in different types of engineering 
tasks including Ops (Kubernetes, Docker, Linux), ETL pipelines, web scraping 
and interactive frontend. My instruments of choice include various Python 
frameworks (Django, Flask, Sanic to name a few) various kinds of databases 
(PostgreSQL, MongoDB) and on occasion - React. I’m also a former technical 
writer (worked on OpenCV documentation), die-hard Linux fan and FOSS-enthusiast.

I use this blog as a notebook to my journey into the unknown. It has no 
persistent format or goal, but it generally revolves around topics of 
productivity and tech.

Stay tuned.
