![My own ThinkPad X201]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20150315_015224.jpg)

For those, who have limited time, this post comes down to the following 
statement: *[Lenovo Thinkpad X201](
http://www.notebookreview.com/notebookreview/lenovo-thinkpad-x201-review) is 
the best X-series Thinkpad created yet*. What follows is my attempt at proving 
this point with my merely anecdotal evidence. I'm funny like that. Here comes a 
short story of my relationship with Lenovo Thinkpad X series.

<!--more-->

In 2013 I've been working as a technical writer (more *technical* than a 
*writer* actually) in a medium-sized web-slash-mobile startup and the Macbook, 
they'd given me, failed and I decided to try something new. At that time I got 
increasingly interested in Lenovo Thinkpad (yeah, it hadn't been IBM for quite 
a long time already). A couple of my colleagues had these [X220](
http://www.notebookreview.com/notebookreview/lenovo-thinkpad-x220-review/) 
machines and they seemed pretty solid and professional, especially with all 
kinds of Linux installed on them (I worked with a bunch of Python devs and 
everybody used their favorite flavor of Linux). My transition from Macbook to 
Thinkpad was also dictated by how Macbook wouldn't let me use [i3 WM](
https://i3wm.org/) (which I was completely sold on at the time) as the main WM. 
So I went to my manager an he approved my order. The problem was I wasn't 
really familiar with modern ThinkPads then and ordered 14" model (thought I 
could use all the extra screen space). I figured any Thinkpad will do, but it 
was a mistake.

I got [T431S](
http://www.notebookreview.com/notebookreview/lenovo-thinkpad-t431s-review/) 
which was admittedly quite expensive at the time, but didn't look like Thinkpad 
at all. If anything it resembled  plastic version of Macbook. It had a rather 
disguising chiclet (island-type) keyboard, no LED indicators, thinner body and 
as a result much less ports (although for the record I do understand S stands 
for slim). The only thing it had in common with the previous generations of 
Thinkpads was the clit, which was kinda useless without the additional row of 
buttons, the device actually had no touchpad buttons at all as it mimicked the 
Macbook-style *platform* touchpad (awful, awful trend, actually). The hardware 
was of questionable quality and it gave me lots of headache on Linux (
especially WiFi) despite the ThinkPads traditionally being considered one of 
the best laptops, when it comes to compatibility with Linux. I worked on this 
machine until the  company went under, and got used to it somehow, but it never 
lived up to the image of Thinkpad I had in my head.

Even after that I didn't give up on the Thinkpad series completely, though it 
clearly went downhill with every subsequent model. My wife got herself X230 at 
work and as I got to play with the device a bit, I had an impression that this 
is not as bad as 431S, so as the line moved forward I decided to go in the 
opposite direction. At that time I started working in a medium enterprise 
infosec company and they had Thinkpads all over the place, and most of these 
were the Thinkpads as I expected them to be from the day one. These were 
X201 models. They aren't as outdated as the earlier ones but they have all the 
right features. Here is a short comparison between some of the latest X series 
models:

<small>* - to be fair Thinkpad X250 actually went back to having hardware 
buttons, so X240 is not the whole new tendency, but rather disappointing 
stumble.</small>

So, to sum it up for X201:

1. There is the right number of LED indicators (X220 and X230 have less and 
   X240 seem to have none whatsoever) and they are mirrored on the back of the 
   machine, which is convenient, when the lid is closed.
2. The classic Thinkpad keyboard is just right for coding. No trendy chiclet 
   bullshit.
3. Ports and slots is the area, where the age of the machine shows the most. It 
   doesn't have any USB 3.0 ports and Mini DisplayPort would be actually nice. 
   Still, it's much better than X240.
4. There are two rows of buttons, one for clit mode and the other for the 
   touchpad. Although I work with clit most of the time, I find having an 
   additional bottom row rather convenient, yet I'd probably go with no 
   touchpad at all if that was an option.
5. Flashlight!

The only problem with X201 model for me is that it's not available for sale 
officially anymore (at least where I live), I even tried to buy out my office 
X201, when leaving the company but they wouldn't let me. So I found a place 
that sold used ThinkPads for a reasonable price and bought one from there. This 
machine is pure magic, and it doesn't matter that it's a bit outdated. It has 
i3 CPU (which is still fair these days), up to 8GB RAM (which is usually 
enough), extended 6 cell battery makes up for its age (easily gives me 5 or 4 
hours of relaxed coding) and overall design hints at the times when the word 
Thinkpad meant something more than *"an ugly plastic Macbook knockoff"*. 
Without much exaggeration I can say, that in 12.5" X line of ThinkPads (at 
least to me) the X201 model seems greatly superior to anything made before (due 
to being relatively modern) or after. It's still relevant today and has the 
potential of being developer's muse (fetishist talking) and workhorse.

*An update is due: although I still think X201 is one of the best ThinkPad 
X-series machines, after a heated Reddit discussion X220 seems to be an even 
better model with all the advantages of X201 (except the amount of LEDs üòè), 
plus newer hardware and better screen. You probably should consider that 
machine if you are shopping for classic ThinkPads.*
