My name is Vsevolod Glumov.

I’m working now as a technical writer with strong focus on code references and 
other developer-oriented materials. I’m also an inspired beginner developer, 
delving into the worlds of Java and Python on my own. You can find links to 
quite a few of my open-source projects on [this page](/projects).

I’m not among the people who have recently joined the industry because they 
heard it may help them to pay their bills. I’m not among the people, constantly 
laying siege to conference halls in search of another million-dollar 
startup idea. I’m here because I’m in the state of being constantly amazed by 
the vast universe of knowledge the 20-year-old industry is now. I want to 
contribute to this and I want to be a part of it.

Along the way I’m getting stuck and puzzled. Sometimes I’m capable of fixing it 
myself, sometimes — some wiser guy comes and helps me. Some of these issues 
were real pearls and it’s a shame that they may be ultimately forgotten. 
Sometimes I suddenly get an idea of how I can improve my performance and 
implement them in my workflow. I start to perform better and it’s a shame I 
have no public space online to tell about this trick. Well, not anymore.

At the end of the day there is no final goal to this blog. Ideally, it should 
have no end, no real destination, as the learning process that it conveys. In 
fact, I wouldn’t even call it a blog. It should be more like the journal of 
the odyssey into the unknown.

Let it be the ultimate mission statement.
