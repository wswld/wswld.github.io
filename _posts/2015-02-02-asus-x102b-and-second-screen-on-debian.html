<p>I've stumbled upon a very capricious piece of hardware lately, which is ASUS X102B. Basic (very basic) video seems to work out of the box, but there are numerous problems here and there. Especially the second screen, which doesn't seem to work at the first glance. If you run <tt>xrandr</tt> it will only recognize the <em>"default"</em> output and even that would look pretty much broken. First thing to do was:</p>
<p>[code language="bash"]<br />
sudo apt-get install firmware-linux-nonfree<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Actually, it's a go-to solution (as in first thing to try) to many Debian hardware-related problems, as the distro doesn't include non-free firmware by default. After that it recognizes most outputs the right way, but it may miss the right modes. If so, you could add your mode manually.</p>
<p>First, retrieve the full information about the mode:</p>
<p>[code language="bash"]<br />
cvt 1920 1080<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>You will get something like that:</p>
<p>[code language="bash"]<br />
# 1920x1080 59.96 Hz (CVT 2.07M9) hsync: 67.16 kHz; pclk: 173.00 MHz<br />
Modeline &quot;1920x1080_60.00&quot;  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Now use the info to add the mode to <tt>xrandr</tt> and then assign it to the output:</p>
<p>[code language="bash"]<br />
xrandr --newmode &quot;1920x1080&quot; 173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -HSync +VSync<br />
xrandr --addmode VGA-0 &quot;1920x1080&quot;<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Use the <tt>xrandr</tt> command to check the list of availible outputs and modes. You probably know that already, but here is how to use <tt>xrandr</tt> with the newly created mode:</p>
<p>[code language="bash"]<br />
xrandr --output VGA-0 --mode &quot;1920x1080&quot;<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Well, as this one issue is officially resolved I'm off to fight the rest of a couple hundred problems, that arise, when trying to use this laptop with Debian. Wish me luck and leave a comment if you had some trouble with the machine (when used with Debian that is) â€” we could try to work it out together.</p>
