You may have noticed that I switched to Poole lately and started playing with 
styles a lot (because Jekyll). My goal was to depart from the default theme as 
much as possible. So I replaced the fonts, link style and started toying with 
various accent colors when I came upon magenta - I absolutely love magenta as an 
accent color. But when I showed the new design around (it was still a light 
theme then) I was referenced to the Family Guy gayjacked plane video above. 
Jokes aside I love the new design, especially as a dark neon theme. So, I hope 
you're enjoying this flight as much as I do because this plane is going to 
Miami!
