*This post was written about a year ago, but it has been lost among the drafts, 
as I haven't been a frequent guest here lately. Now it's time to finally 
publish this piece for good.*

Some time ago I did a big, comprehensive [review](
http://wswld.net/2013/07/20/bioaid-meets-life-2/) of the [BioAid](
http://bioaid.org.uk/) hearing app for iOS. A couple of months down the road, 
the situation has changed entirely. I've got some good news and some bad news 
for you. Let's start with the latter.

### Bad News

I've joined the dark side and after several months of struggling, I've finally bought a commercial hearing aid. It is not a spontaneous decision though, I've 
been thoroughly thinking it over for a couple of weeks. Here is what made my 
mind up:

* I've started to notice some discomfort while using BioAid, for the most part 
  it was minor headache and mental fatigue. I've been taking some medications, 
  that could have caused this effect too, but I do believe BioAid had its share 
  of responsibility in driving me into this condition. As I've been using 
  *Gradual HF* regime, it could be a little too high frequency in my case. Not 
  high enough to notice that at once, but it had some profound effect on me in 
  the long run. I was feeling ruined by the weekday evenings after the full day 
  of continuous use of BioAid at work, and I was feeling OK on weekends, when I 
  hardly used the app at all. I think it was natural fatugue, combined with the 
  sound irritant of BioAid. I'm not saying that you're sure to be feeling 
  exactly the same way, but I strongly recommend you to stop using the app as 
  soon as you feel any side effects. You should also consider starting using 
  the app twice if you have any sort of rare medical condition. The creators of 
  the app warn you about that themselves.
* Annoying state of being unable to use my iPhone to its full potential 
  throughout the day and implications of using it as a hearing aid in 
  day-to-day situations made me feel quite miserable. If you're interested in 
  what I'm speaking about, I've been writing about all the limitations in the 
  [original post](http://wswld.net/2013/07/20/bioaid-meets-life-2/). However, 
  it could be alright, if you really can't afford a hearing aid, or want to use 
  the app as a temporary solution.

As a result, I went to the same center, where I've refused to buy an aid in the 
first place and bought the same exact aid I had been offered back then. It is 
OK (Widex, by the way), but I've not changed my mind completely. I do think 
that devices like BioAid are the future of hearing aid market, which is really 
underdeveloped and monopolistic in this day and age.

### Good News

Some time ago I got this letter in my inbox:

> Dear Vsevolod,

> You contacted me a couple of months back about the original BioAid app. I'd

Dr. Nick Clark is one of the scientists behind the original BioAid project (the 
one who wrote most of ObjC code, actually) and [Aud1](http://www.aud1.com/) is 
his solo project. <del datetime="2014-08-13T13:37:08+00:00">Yes, basically it's BioAid 2.0 and it's paid now.</del> *Actually, it's not BioAid 2.0, but rather implementation of BioAid algorithm, as Nick Clark himself [explained it](
http://www.hearingaidforums.com/showthread.php?15501-BioAid-is-now-a-product-called-Aud1):*

I installed the app and field-tested it right away. I was glad to see that some 
of the annoying issues of the original version were gone. The app features much 
cleaner interface and more flexible configuration with sliders instead of fixed 
presets. There are no more welcome popup screens appearing every time on 
startup and the app seems to preserve the configuration on relaunch.

It also has introduced some new features like an ability to choose bit rate of 
the output, support for stereo, latency test and input/output calibration. It 
also provides some basic session info and a logger for the tinkerers. The 
application now looks more mature and ready for commercial distribution. 
Although no essential improvement over the original app was introduced, it 
looks, feels and *hears* much better, which is enough for me to reach for my 
wallet. Still, there are issues, that were ignored, like returning to hearing 
aid mode after a call (as the stock music app does) and some other minor 
problems. Regimes are the same for the most part (albeit a tad more 
configurable), hence it haven't solved my headache problem. Eventually, I've 
abandoned the concept of iPhone as *the everyday* hearing aid. Again, it 
doesn't mean it would not work for you. Give it a try.

By the end of the day I do think that this version is worth every pence, even 
if you're not particularly amazed with the new features and improvements. You 
may consider it a little contribution to an amazing project, especially if you 
have been using the original BioAid for some time already. After many months of 
extensive BioAid usage, I was glad to pay it back. Hopefully, you would be too. 
If you're completely new to this kind of apps, my advice would be to try BioAid 
first and see, whether you're not experiencing any of the side effects and it 
does help your hearing, then you could easily migrate to Aud1.

*A little year-down-the-road update is due. As of now the projects seems a 
abandoned: last updates on [BioAid](https://www.facebook.com/bioaidapp) and 
[Aud1](https://www.facebook.com/aud1app) Facebook pages date back to September 
13, 2013. It is quite unfortunate as the project showed big promise. Hopefully, 
Nick Clark haven't abandoned this idea completely and works on something new in 
the same vein. Time will tell.*
