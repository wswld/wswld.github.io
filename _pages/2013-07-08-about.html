<p>My name is Vsevolod Glumov.</p>
<p>I’m working now as a technical writer with strong focus on code references and other developer-oriented materials. I’m also an inspired beginner developer, delving into the worlds of Java and Python on my own. You can find links to quite a few of my open-source <a href="http://projects.wswld.net">projects</a> on this site. You may be also interested in seeing my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/vsevolod-glumov/46/353/141">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wswld">GitHub</a> profiles. If you're interested in the purpose of this site, here is the <a href="http://wswld.net/2013/06/07/introduction/">mission statement</a>.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
