<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I have undiagnosed albeit really strong OCD when it comes to productivity systems. I've tried them all. Literally. I went all the way from basic ones like Wunderlist (it was really basic back then), Trello and Cultured Code's Things to the maddening horror of installing and maintaining your own instance of Redmine (yeah, just for personal tasks) and back. And I did this million times in both directions. My copy of GTD looks like Times Square from all the layers of highlighter. I mean when it comes to me, productivity methodologies and mental health, things are pretty bad. Needless to say that if I decide to implement something in my routine, I develop some kind of resolution, describing what I'm gonna implement and what way exactly and then (oh god) I adhere to that zelously. Just so that you have a picture here, I have a really overdeveloped, nerdy routine by which I've been living many years, I change it from time to time, yeah, but it stays just that for the most part - bureacrastic routine. </p>
<p>Over the time I've introduced many new modules, based on what I've read, seen and thought of:</p>
