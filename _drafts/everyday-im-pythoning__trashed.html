<p>I went for a snack yesterday, to find some solace from numbing pain of office existence. You know you need those lunner snacks, because you thought you worked really hard this afternoon and without some high-carb reward all this work doesn't really make sense. Yeah, I said it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm in a supermarket, making rounds in a sweets&amp;chocolate aisle and feeling disgusted with myself. And the decision fatigue is creeping in from all those choices.You know the best remedy from decision fatigue, right? Yes, you gotta delegate the choice to someone else. I’ve been using people for that, but it’s getting hard to find a willing decision donor after all those years of abusing the social circle, so these days I’m using the Internet. More precisely <a href="https://yesno.wtf/">yesno.wtf</a>  and the site is a marvel. Not only it provides an answer to your binary question of choice, you also get a fun gif as a bonus. Here go some usage examples:</p>
<p>— Should I go to the office today?<br />
— No.<br />
— Okay. Cool.</p>
<p>— Should I play Xbox?<br />
— No!<br />
— Should I play Xbox if I really want to?<br />
— Yes!<br />
— Thanks.</p>
<p>You get the idea. So I wanted the site to decide for me what kind of chocolate snack I’ll be indulging in today. I've already managed to limit the choices to M&amp;Ms and a Ritter Sport bar. The only problem: I’m getting no LTE in that semi-basement store. I tried to do the decision myself, but it’s just too hard after decades of delegation. I was standing there for a couple of minutes in complete despair until I remembered the Pythonista. You probably heard about it already, but if you didn't, you should definitely check it out. It's the best way to python on iOS devices, trust me.</p>
<p>So I fire up the app, and code up the following:</p>
<p>[code lang=python]<br />
from random import choice</p>
<p>print choice([‘ritter’, ‘m&amp;m&#039;])<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>I got the result immediately without usual waiting for HTTP to do its nasty business and returned to the office with a Ritter Sport bar and obscene amount of carb guilt. Although I have the whole power of standard library an beyond right in my pocket, it never occurred to me to use Python for making decisions. We gotta pair it up with some machine learning and personalization and no human will ever have to make another decision again.</p>
<p>Aren’t that all we ever secretly longed for?</p>
