<h1 id="stuff-i-do-with-beeminder">Stuff I do with Beeminder</h1>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Beeminder is a goal-tracking tool for nerds like us. It helps beat procrastination into the ground with progress feedback (graphs!) and a simple commitment mechanism (money pledge!). The fact how well it works makes me uneasy, as I think no reasonable human being should use money pledges to get down to business, in ideal world, but everything is much more complicated. And here we are, pledging money on brushing our teeth.</p>
<p>I won't go into much detail about the service itself, the guys are doing good job on that front. But as I've been exploring my beeminding options lately I've came up with a bunch of rather creative solutions I wanted to share.</p>

<p>Most of the stuff I'm listing here is not rocket science and I have a couple of ideas I haven't properly tested yet, so more stuff is coming.</p>

<p>Among the <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/featured">featured</a> goals there is one by <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/adamwolf">adamwolf</a> using <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/adamwolf/pocket_age">cumulative sum of age of all articles in his pocket</a>. I found this idea interesting and explored it in other domain: Trello. So, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/wswld/beeminder_scripts#trelloage">a bot</a> that adds a datapoint with average age of cards in a Trello board of choice (I went with my main one) daily. I've chosen average because this way I'd bee rewarded for both adding a bunch of new cards and archiving the older ones.</p>
<p>The fluctuations and noise of this kind of data is well taken care off with weight less type of goal as it makes the yellow brick road a little bit wider. I still use the classic Trello integration (archived items) together with this one.</p>
