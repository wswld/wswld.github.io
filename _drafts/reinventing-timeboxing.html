<h2>Pomodoro</h2>
<p>My first introduction to timeboxing was an good old Pomodoro technique. Of course if you practice it to the point it's not all about timeboxing, but in the end of the day it boils down to just that - rigid 30 minute timeboxing. I was experimenting with it for several years to some degree of success. There were a couple caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 minutes (25 actually if you count 5 minute break) is too short an unit. I only start to get into flow after 10 or 15 minutes and you have 10 minutes of work before the sudden break time.</li>
<li>It's very rigid. The original techique has lots of, well, technicalities, that ultimately make it kinda pain in the ass. I want to skip breaks from time to time. I want to add past pomodoros (originally you should only use timer for that and some clients are boasting this as a feature).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are two points my concerns with Pomodoro technique boil down to. After some time I started to skip pomodoros and avoid them altogether. Some people suggest scheduling them but they are too small for that. Managing a calendar full of 30 min. blocks is no fun. I started looking for other ideas.</p>
<h2>90 minute session</h2>
<p>In a book (find the book) an interesting research is mentioned. Our brain works in cycles called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultradian_rhythm">ultradian rhythms</a>. Theese are 90-120 minute cycles of increased activity and then productivity slumps for half an hour or so. There are several studies proving this thery and as a result there are reccomendations to work in 90 minute cycles with 30 minute break. It works. As soon as you find your schedule it does wonders. But it too have some caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not everyone have a luxury of several uninterrupted 90 minute sessions per day. We have our distractions, lunchtime, phone calls and colleagues approaches. Some even argue the Pomodoro technique is unsustainable because of that, and here we are dealing with even bigger time chunks.</li>
<li>It's not very healthy. Any doctor would tell you it's unhealthy to sit for so long without a proper break. I'm not going to list here all the health issues that may arise from such a lifestyle.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, although 90 minute sessions are closer to what humans are supposed to work in, it still has its limitations. So what do we do?</p>
<h2> Solution</h2>
<p>Use both. You read it right. Use a combination of both systems. Here's how it looks on a graph.</p>
